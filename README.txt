Reproducibility steps for the paper
===================================

Setup
-----

Read first, then run the `0-setup.sh` script.


Re-run experiments
------------------

The script `1-launch-exps.sh` launches the experiments. You have to select the
type of problem and whether to run CEGO and/or UMM. You may need to adapt the
script for your computing system.


How to reproduce the plots and tables without re-running
---------------------------------------------------------

Open notebook `2-An intro to UMM.ipynb`, evaluate the first cell (imports),
then evaluate the cells in the sections that interest you.
